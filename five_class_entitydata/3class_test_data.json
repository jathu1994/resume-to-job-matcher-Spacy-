In 7+ Years of total experience (2.5+ years in Data Science, 2.5 years in SAP implementation, support & 1.5 development.)\n· Presently associated with Tata Consultancy Services Bengaluru as a Data Scientist and previously associated with PDIL, NOIDA, Sr. Engineer (Computer).\n· Organisational Experience\n\n\t1.\n\tCompany 2: TCS, Bengaluru -- (Dec 2011 to present)\n\n\t\n\tProject 1 : NLP (Email Analysis engine)\n \nClassifying incoming e-mail from customers to related product using e-mail subject and body text.\nE-mail will be classified in related product queue and issue will be addressed accordingly. \n\nResponsibilities:\n \n\n 1) Worked on data labelling for this project and label around 1000 data points.\n\n 2) Worked on data pre-processing.\n\n 3) Reading mail and getting intent and entity of mail.\n\n 3) Worked on prototyping/Model Creation for mail classification.\nProject 2: Client: US based bank (Churn Analysis)\nDeposits are the key phenomenon for any bank. SunTrust has a total of 18 million deposit accounts belonging to individuals, corporate and affiliates. Each year, SunTrust adds 2-3 million new accounts but the grand total of accounts has plateau at 18 million. This implies that there are as many customer accounts churning out that keeps the grand total largely unchanged. The Analytics team was called in to perform a deep dive analysis to identify the Key performance indicators that contribute to the customer attrition. This project needed to answer two business questions:\n\n1) Will the customer churn?\n\n2) Can we predict the when the customer will churn?\n\n3) Played the role of Analyst working with the business to come up with a statistical model to reduce the deposit attrition and was involved in the following tasks\n\nResponsibilities:\n\n1)  Understand business problem to be solved and formulate analytics problem statement.\n\n2)  Identify the response/dependant variable Y - what does churn mean?\n\n3)  Perform data requirement analysis to conclude whether the data is present to solve the problem.\n\n4)  The available data set had transactional data of all the 18 million account holders that ran into millions of records.

Model was developed to identify overall hospital rating using decision trees. This analysis helps hospital regulatory body to rate any new hospital that comes into system by identifying on some basic parameters, like patient admission procedure in hospital, behaviour of doctors and supporting staff, hospital care, timeliness, hygienic condition, type of hospital and  mode of payment before exit. Decision tree algorithm was used in this model to identify factors to find the overall ratings of a hospital.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\n1) Worked with project team to understand the problem and business requirements.\n\n2) Worked with developers to extract data from HDFS.      \n\n3) Imported data into Python and R for exploring and understanding the data.\n\n4) Exploring the data and data structures for developing model.\n\n5) Prepared data for creating training and test sets. \n\n6) Developed hospital rating model to identify overall rating using decision tree algorithm.\n\n7) Communicated results using presentations and visualization.\nEnvironment: Linux, Hadoop, MySQL, R, R-Studio\n\n\n\n\t2.\n\tCompany 1: Projects and Development India Limited, NOIDA-- (Oct 2010 to Nov 2011)\nPDIL is a PSU (Government of India, under the ministry of chemical & fertilizer).

Most predictive analytics applications have a complete target variable which can be analyzed. Fraud is unique in that there is generally a lot of fraud that has occurred historically that has not been identified.  There is a natural assumption that the past will bear some resemblance to the future. In the case of fraud, methods of defrauding insurance companies change quickly and it can make the analysis of a historical database less valuable for identifying future fraud.  Identify fraud and allow an insurer to optimize the resources they have available in combating this fraud. \n\n More consistent referral of suspicious claims to claim investigative units , Better identification of suspicious claims, even as techniques used to defraud insurers are changing and  Incorporating claim adjuster insight into analytics results to improve the process.\n\nPROJECT: 2\n\tClient Name\n\tAVIVA\n\n\tProject Title\n\tAVIVA – Application Maintenance Onsite SPoC\n\n\tPeriod\n\n\tJan 2013 to May 2016\n\n\tPosition\n\n\tOnsite Lead\n\n\tResponsibilities\n\t· Playing the role of a Team Lead, Issue tracking & Status Reporting\n\n· Leading a team of 4, coordinating and supporting them on their activities, and also involved in Enhancement/ Change Requests.\n\n· Extensive client interaction as part of the activities.\n\n· Experience in understanding client business requirements and preparation of use cases for the same.\n\n\tProject\n\t· AVIA is Specialty Insurers are one of the world's leading specialty Insurance Company.
